Quick example to show how to display a busy indicator over an item in a
QTreeView.  Just run the busy-item.py from this directory and click on an item
in the view to reveal a busy indicator. The code handles repositioning the
indicator when the tree view is scrolled, resized, and when the header sections
are resized. There may be other cases that aren't handled.
